LINE 95 AND LINE 120(passing argument into select_seat) : its the way lambda works. Writing like this lets me get seat_number for each seat at button press. Further understand what lambda does

NOTE : If a seat is blocked or booked ie state is disabled it cannot be clicked, As such i do not need
       assign text to said seat since nothing from that seat ever needs to be passed into select_seat


 0 is available, 1 is blocked 2 is booked

 odd  numbers are spaces(used for formatting)
 trip_det[0] is plane_id
